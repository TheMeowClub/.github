## About Meow Club

Meow Club is a playful open‑source organization built around a neko‑inspired aesthetic, cute UI, and delightful developer experiences. [web:3]  
From tiny utilities to full-stack playgrounds, every project here aims to feel like a comfy cat café for your code. [web:5]

## What We Do

- 🐱 Build cute, polished frontends with strong UX and beautiful visuals. [web:3]  
- 🎮 Experiment with playful interactions, animations, and game‑inspired UI. [web:9]  
- 🌙 Craft dark, cozy, and “neko” themed components for the modern web. [web:9]  
- 🤝 Encourage collaboration, learning, and chill vibes over perfection. [web:5]

## Getting Started

1. Browse the organization repositories and pick a project that interests you. [web:8]

3. Open an issue if you:

   - Want to suggest a new cat‑themed feature  
   - Need help getting started [web:12]

## Contributing

Meow Club is open to contributors of all skill levels. [web:3]

- Fork the repository you want to work on. [web:3]  
- Create a feature branch with a clear name (for example: `feature/add-neko-button`). [web:3]  
- Keep pull requests small, focused, and well‑described. [web:11]  
- Be kind and respectful in discussions — this is a safe space for learning. [web:12]

Ideas for contributions:

- New components (buttons, cards, loaders) in Meow Club style  
- Accessibility improvements and performance tweaks  
- Documentation, examples, and starter templates  
- Theme variations (night mode, pastel mode, cyber‑neko, etc.) [web:9]

## Design & Branding

- **Logo:** Use the official Meow Club logo image from this README for public materials. [web:7]  
- **Style:** Cute, clean, and modern with a touch of neko and subtle “animated” energy.  
- **Vibes:** Cozy, playful, and welcoming — like a cat peeking over your screen while you code.

When in doubt, ask: “Does this feel like something a stylish cat developer would love?”
