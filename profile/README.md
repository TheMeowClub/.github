## About Meow Club

Meow Club is a playful open-source organization built around a neko-inspired aesthetic, cute UI, and delightful developer experiences.
From tiny utilities to full-stack playgrounds, every project here aims to feel like a comfy cat café for your code.

---

## What We Do

- 🐱 Build cute, polished frontends with strong UX and beautiful visuals.  
- 🎮 Experiment with playful interactions, animations, and game-inspired UI.  
- 🌙 Craft dark, cozy, and “neko” themed components for the modern web.  
- 🤝 Encourage collaboration, learning, and chill vibes over perfection.

---

## Getting Started

1. Browse the organization repositories and pick a project that interests you.  
2. Read that project’s individual `README.md` for setup and contribution details.  
3. Open an issue if you:
   - Find a bug  
   - Want to suggest a new cat-themed feature  
   - Need help getting started

## Contributing

Meow Club is open to contributors of all skill levels.

- Fork the repository you want to work on.  
- Create a feature branch with a clear name (for example: `feature/add-neko-button`).  
- Keep pull requests small, focused, and well-described.  
- Be kind and respectful in discussions — this is a safe space for learning.

Ideas for contributions:

- New components (buttons, cards, loaders) in Meow Club style  
- Accessibility improvements and performance tweaks  
- Documentation, examples, and starter templates  
- Theme variations (night mode, pastel mode, cyber-neko, etc.)

## Design & Branding

- **Logo:** Use the official Meow Club logo image from this README for public materials.  
- **Style:** Cute, clean, and modern with a touch of neko and subtle “animated” energy.  
- **Vibes:** Cozy, playful, and welcoming — like a cat peeking over your screen while you code.

When in doubt, ask: “Does this feel like something a stylish cat developer would love?”
